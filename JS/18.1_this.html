    In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the code.
    Its value depends on the context in which the function was called.
    Here are several contexts in which this might be used and its respective behavior:`);

    console.log(`
    Global Context:
    When used in the global scope, this refers to the global object (window in browsers, global in Node.js).`);
    console.log(this); // In a browser, this will log the window object.

    console.log(`
    Function Context:
    In a regular function, this refers to the global object (in non-strict mode) or undefined (in strict mode).`)
    function myFunction() {
        console.log(this); // In non-strict mode: window (browser) or global (Node.js)
                      // In strict mode: undefined
    }
    myFunction();

    console.log(`
    Method Context:
    when a function is called as a method on an object, this refers to that object.`);
    const obj = {
    name: 'object',
        showName: function() {
            console.log(this.name); // Logs 'object'
        }
    };

    obj.showName();

    console.log(`
    Constructor Function Context:
    When used inside a constructor function, this refers to the newly created instance.`);
    function Person(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    const person = new Person('Alice');
    console.log(person.name); // Logs 'Alice'

    console.log(`
    Arrow Function Context:
    Arrow functions do not have their own this binding. Instead, this is lexically inherited from the parent scope.
    With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.`);
    const obj1 = {
    name: 'object',
    showName: function() {
        const arrowFunction = () => {
            console.log(this.name); // Logs 'object' because it inherits `this` from showName
        };
        arrowFunction();
    }
    };
